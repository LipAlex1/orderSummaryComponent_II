## Overview

A simple single website design of an exemplary order summary. Only HTML and CSS to be used, no functionality through JS, API or any other as such.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and active states for interactive elements

### Links

- Solution URL: https://github.com/LipAlex1/orderSummaryComponent
- Live Site URL: https://lipalex1.github.io/orderSummaryComponent/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

At this stage I found myself proficient at the HTML and CSS required to finish the project. I learned a lot about my schedule and the time requirements for a projects like this.

I managed breakpoints better than in previous projects guided by Google Chrome's developer tools. The design eventually suits Chrome browsers best, although I am personally not discontent with the site's performance in Firefox and Opera in their respective latest versions. I will address code reviewers to instruct me on how to fix the bungled look the site has in Internet Explorer. Also, the design has not been tested on Safari, since I have no Apple device to properly test the site design.

I used the :root pseudo class instead of the html selctor in CSS to implement its rules on a higher level but had to find out that it did not create universal rules for the font-family which is why there may be redundant CSS code. Also in this I will ask advice from code reviewers.

I find myself becoming more proficient at the use of Figma. It has become obvious that it is a key skill to be able to analyze designs ans layouts and how to extract all kinds of information like spaces, color schemes and interaction.

### Continued development

The immediate need for improvement can be derived from the section above:

1. Necessary improvements to the site to display correctly in Internet Explorer.
2. Figuring out a way to test this design as well as future designs for Apple's Safari browser (and other Apple browsers if applicable)
3. Researching the proper use of :root pseudo class

The larger building blocks of grid-systems, CSS preprocessors, JS and its libraries remain a field of constant activity until proficiency can be tested with further projects beyond the scope of this one.
